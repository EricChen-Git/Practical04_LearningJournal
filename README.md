   - Created a new database using phpMyAdmin, configuring it for the WordPress installation.

4. **WordPress Configuration:**
   - Edited the 'wp-config.php' file to include database details (database name, username, password).

5. **Theme Deployment:**
   - Implemented a child theme based on Twenty Twenty to customize and enhance the appearance of the WordPress site.

6. **Child Theme Learning Resources:**
   - Utilized the WordPress Child Themes documentation, a YouTube tutorial, and a LinkedIn Learning course to gain comprehensive insights into child theme creation.

## Content Insights:
